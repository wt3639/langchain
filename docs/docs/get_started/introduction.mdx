# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](/docs/expression_language/) and [components](/docs/modules/). Hit the ground running using [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/) and [Templates](/docs/templates).
- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn any chain into an API with [LangServe](/docs/langserve).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Partner packages (e.g. **`langchain-openai`**, **`langchain-anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`langchain-core`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[langgraph](/docs/langgraph)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- **[langserve](/docs/langserve)**: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.

The broader ecosystem includes:

- **[LangSmith](/docs/langsmith)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

## Get started

We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

[See here](/docs/get_started/installation) for instructions on how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

:::note

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.

## Use cases

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our [use-cases](/docs/use_cases).
They're walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end tasks, such as:

- [Question answering with RAG](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)
- [Extracting structured output](/docs/use_cases/extraction/)
- [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots/)
- and more!


## Expression Language

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest ‚Äúprompt + LLM‚Äù chain to the most complex chains.

- **[Get started](/docs/expression_language/)**: LCEL and its benefits
- **[Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface)**: The standard interface for LCEL objects
- **[Primitives](/docs/expression_language/primitives)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes
- and more!
