# Components

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following main components:

## [Model I/O](/docs/modules/model_io/)
Formatting and managing language model input and output

### [Prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts)
Formatting for LLM inputs that guide generation

### [Chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/chat)
Interfaces for language models that use chat messages as inputs and returns chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text).

### [LLMs](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)
Interfaces for language models that use plain text as input and output

## [Retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection/)
Interface with application-specific data for e.g. RAG

### [Document loaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/)
Load data from a source as `Documents` for later processing

### [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)
Transform source documents to better suit your application

### [Embedding models](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/)
Create vector representations of a piece of text, allowing for natural language search

### [Vectorstores](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)
Interfaces for specialized databases that can search over unstructured data with natural language

### [Retrievers](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/)
More generic interfaces that return documents given an unstructured query

## [Composition](/docs/modules/composition/)
Higher-level components that combine other arbitrary systems and/or or LangChain primitives together

### [Tools](/docs/modules/tools/)
Interfaces that allow an LLM to interact with external systems

### [Agents](/docs/modules/agents/)
Constructs that choose which tools to use given high-level directives

### [Chains](/docs/modules/chains/)
Building block-style compositions of other runnables

## Additional

### [Memory](/docs/modules/memory/)
Persist application state between runs of a chain

### [Callbacks](/docs/modules/callbacks/)
Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
