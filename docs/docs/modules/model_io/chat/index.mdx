# Chat Models

Chat Models are a core component of LangChain.

A chat model is a language model that uses chat messages as inputs and returns chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain text).

LangChain has integrations with many model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.) and exposes a standard interface to interact with all of these models.

LangChain allows you to use models in sync, async, batching and streaming modes and provides other features (e.g., caching) and more.
