    "[OctoAI](https://docs.octoai.cloud/docs) offers easy access to efficient compute and enables users to integrate their choice of AI models into applications. The `OctoAI` compute service helps you run, tune, and scale AI applications easily.\n",

    "This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `OctoAI` [LLM endpoints](https://octoai.cloud/templates)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run our example app, there are two simple steps to take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get an API Token from [your OctoAI account page](https://octoai.cloud/settings).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Paste your API key in in the code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you want to use a different LLM model, you can containerize the model and make a custom OctoAI endpoint yourself, by following [Build a Container from Python](https://octo.ai/docs/bring-your-own-model/advanced-build-a-container-from-scratch-in-python) and [Create a Custom Endpoint from a Container](https://octo.ai/docs/bring-your-own-model/create-custom-endpoints-from-a-container/create-custom-endpoints-from-a-container) and then update your Endpoint URL in the code cell below.\n"
