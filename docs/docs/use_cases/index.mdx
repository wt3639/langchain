# Use cases

This section contains walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use tasks.

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, try one out!
While they reference building blocks that are explained in greater detail in other sections, we absolutely
encourage folks to get started by going through them and picking apart the code in a real-world context.

Or, if you prefer to look at the fundamentals first, you can check out the sections on [Expression Language](/docs/expression_language/get_started)
and the various [components](/docs/modules) LangChain provides for more background knowledge.
