    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt**: Update our prompt to support historical messages as an input.\n",
    "2. **Contextualizing questions**: Add a sub-chain that takes the latest user question and reformulates it in the context of the chat history. This is needed in case the latest question references some context from past messages. For example, if a user asks a follow-up question like \"Can you elaborate on the second point?\", this cannot be understood without the context of the previous message. Therefore we can't effectively perform retrieval with a question like this."
