By defining a common interface or ABC for all these classes, we can ensure consistency and better organize the codebase.

       "\"A RunnableBinding is a high-level class in the LangChain framework. It's an abstraction layer that sits between a program and an LLM or other data source.\\n\\nThe main goal of a RunnableBinding is to enable a program, which may be a chat bot or a backend service, to fetch responses from an LLM or other data sources in a way that is easy for both the program and the data sources to use. This is achieved through a set of predefined protocols that are implemented by the RunnableBinding.\\n\\nThe protocols defined by a RunnableBinding include:\\n\\n1. Fetching inputs from the program. The RunnableBinding should be able to receive inputs from the program and translate them into a format that can be processed by the LLM or other data sources.\\n2. Translating outputs from the LLM or other data sources into something that can be returned to the program. This includes converting the raw output of an LLM into something that is easier for the program to process, such as text or a structured object.\\n3. Handling errors that may arise during the fetching, processing, and returning of responses from the LLM or other data sources. The RunnableBinding should be able to catch exceptions and errors that occur during these operations and return a suitable error message or response to the program.\\n4. Managing concurrency and parallelism in the communication with the LLM or other data sources. This may include things like allowing multiple requests to be sent to the LLM or other data sources simultaneously, handling the responses asynchronously, and retrying failed requests.\\n5. Providing a way for the program to set configuration options that affect how the RunnableBinding interacts with the LLM or other data sources. This could include things like setting up credentials, providing additional contextual information to the LLM or other data sources, and controlling logging or error handling behavior.\\n\\nIn summary, a RunnableBinding provides a way for a program to easily communicate with an LLM or other data sources without having to know about the details of how they work. By providing a consistent interface between the program and the data sources, the RunnableBinding enables more robust and scalable communication protocols that are easier for both parties to use.\\n\\nIn the context of the chatbot tutorial, a RunnableBinding may be used to fetch responses from an LLM and return them as output for the bot to process. The RunnableBinding could also be used to handle errors that occur during this process, such as providing error messages or retrying failed requests to the LLM.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n* A RunnableBinding provides a way for a program to communicate with an LLM or other data sources without having to know about the details of how they work.\\n* It enables more robust and scalable communication protocols that are easier for both parties to use.\\n* It manages concurrency and parallelism in the communication with the LLM or other data sources.\\n* It provides a way for the program to set configuration options that affect how the RunnableBinding interacts with the LLM or other data sources.\""
