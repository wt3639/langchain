    "One key advantage of the `Runnable` interface is that any two runnables can be \"chained\" together into sequences. The output of the previous runnable's `.invoke()` call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the pipe operator (`|`), or the more explicit `.pipe()` method, which does the same thing. The resulting `RunnableSequence` is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or piped just like any other runnable.\n",

We'll walk through a common pattern in LangChain: using a [prompt template](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/) to format input into a [chat model](/docs/modules/model_io/chat/), and finally converting the chat message output into a string with an [output parser](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/)."

Cultivating a good sense of humor takes practice, and not every joke is going to land. The important thing is to keep experimenting and finding what works. Maybe try for a more unexpected or creative twist on beet-related humor next time.
