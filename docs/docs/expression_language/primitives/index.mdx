# Primitives

In addition to various [components](/docs/modules) that are usable with LCEL, LangChain also includes various primitives
that help pass around and format data, bind arguments, invoke custom logic, and more.

This section goes into greater depth on where and how some of these components are useful.

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item) => item.href !== "/docs/expression_language/primitives/")} />
